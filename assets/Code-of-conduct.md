# Code of conduct

Each creator trusts you to find everything he must knows to improve his app.
We know it's not an easy task that's why our goal is to make it easy for you to give feedbacks.

Be true, be honest, be nice.

We creating this guide to make sure we all agree on the 

1) Confirm your participation to a test only when you can

A test takes a bit of your time and most of the creator are probably in a rush to get the results.
So we ask you to only take part to a test only when you are available pretty quickly.
Don't worry, if you say no, we will still ask you for the next test matching your profile.

2) Be as clear as possible

When you have a bug or a strange behaviour, please take some time to find out why.
It's easy to fix a bug with a scenario, it's really hard when nobody knows how to reproduce an issue.
The other main difficulty is you or the creator may not be an english native. Everyone has its own knowledge and culture.
So that means, note everything you did to have this issue in an easy language. Even better, add an image or a video to show your issue.

3) Reward

We are trying to find the right balance between the creator who may creating his first app, you who is trying hard to help him and us, to find the best means for all parts.
We know a test can take time so we really want you to feel confortable with the pay we propose you.
For a simple test, we consider it can takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours. Please notify us, if you spent more than that.
In any case, if you are not feeling happy with the reward, notify us!
