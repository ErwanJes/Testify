      <p>
        Your main job is to help a creator to improve his/her app(s).<br/>
        We know it's not an easy task that's why our goal is to make it easy for you and to reward for your work and your energy.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>For that, we need you to follow this 3 principles:</p>
      <div class="small-div">
        <p class="small-quote">Be honest, be clear, be helpful</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h2>
        1) Be honest
      </h2>
      <p>
        A test takes a bit of your time and most of the creators are probably in a rush to get the results.<br/>
        So we ask you to only take part of a test when you are available and ready to do it.<br/><br/>
        Don't worry, if you say no, we will still ask you for the next test matching your profile.<br/>
        You will receive your reward once the mission is done and you have filled everything.<br/><br/>
        Participate only once to the same test.<br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>
          2) Be as clear as possible
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of the main difficulty is the communication. You or the creator may not be an english native. Everyone has its own knowledge and culture.<br/>
        So you need to communicate in the most simple way, simple words, simple sentences, so that everyone can understand each other.<br/>
        Even better, add an image or a video to explain your case.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>
          3) Be helpful
      </h2>
      <p>
        When you have a bug or an unexpecting behaviour try to find out why. It's easy to fix a bug with a scenario, it's really hard without it.<br/><br/>
        In all circumstances please take the time to explain, keeping in mind that the ultimate goal is to make the best app ever.<br/>
        Be helpful does not mean being nice, you need to be honest, so the creator can better understand how you use the app and why you do or don't love it.<br/>
        But never harm or denigrate an app.<br/>
      </p>
      <h3>On the other hand we will provide everything to help you and to reward you as fair as possible.</h3>
